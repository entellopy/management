## CEO Archetype Simulation – Leadership Under Complexity
This repository contains a prototype simulation built using [Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (an agent-based modeling framework in Python) to explore how different CEO leadership styles influence organizational outcomes over time.

#### Purpose  
In an era shaped by technological disruption, shifting labor dynamics, and systemic uncertainty, leadership agility is a strategic necessity. This simulation models five distinct CEO personas and their interactions with team agents to reflect how leadership traits affect key business metrics.

#### Model 
- **CEO Archetypes**: Visionary, Operator, Diplomat, Maverick, Analyst  
- **Team Dynamics**: Morale and productivity feedback loops  
- **KPIs Tracked**: Revenue, Morale, Innovation, AI Adoption  
- **Time Horizon**: 50 simulated quarters

#### Use Cases  
- Strategic foresight and scenario testing  
- Leadership fit analysis for boards and HR teams  
- Organizational design and talent planning  
- Educational or consulting use for complexity modeling

#### Outputs  
The simulation generates time-series data and visualizations comparing CEO performance across revenue and morale. A radar chart summarizes leadership traits for strategic interpretation.
